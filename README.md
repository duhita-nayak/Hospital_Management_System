# Hospital_Management_System
I developed this Hospital Management System as a backend solution for efficiently managing various hospital operations.
This C program implements a simple Hospital Management System that allows users to add, view, search, edit, and delete patient information.
Data Structure: The program defines a structure ad that holds patient information,
including:
name: Patient's name.
disease: Disease the patient is suffering from.
cabin: Cabin number assigned to the patient.
phone: Patient's phone number.
age: Patient's age.

Functions:
read(): Reads patient data from a file named patient.txt.
write(): Writes patient data to patient.txt.
add(): Allows the user to add new patient records.
view(): Displays all patient records.
search(): Searches for a patient based on various criteria.
edit(): Edits existing patient records.
del(): Deletes a patient record or clears specific information.

Main Menu: The program presents a simple menu for user interaction, allowing choices for adding, viewing, searching, editing, deleting patient information, or exiting the program.
